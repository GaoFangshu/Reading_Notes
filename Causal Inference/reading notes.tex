\section{A definition of causal effect}
\subsection{Individual causal effects}
\begin{mdframed}
Causal effect for individual $i$: 
\begin{center}
	$Y_{i}^{a=1} \neq Y_{i}^{a=0}$
\end{center}
the treatment $A$ has a causal effect on an individualâ€™s outcome $Y$ if $Y^{a=1} \neq Y^{a=0}$ for the individual.
\end{mdframed}
That is, for individual $i$,  $Y^{a=1}$ (is a random variable, read $Y$ under treatment $a=1$), the outcome variable that would have been observed under the treatment value $a=1$ is not equal to the outcome variable that would have been observed under the treatment value $a=0$ ($Y^{a=0}$). The variables  $Y^{a=1}$ and $Y^{a=0}$ are referred to as \textit{potential outcomes} or as \textit{counterfactual outcomes}. In economics, we often refer ``counterfactual outcomes'' to outcomes that had not happend. But here, both $Y^{a=0}$ and $Y^{a=1}$ are counterfactual outcomes, no matter auctually $a=0$ or $a=1$. 

the counterfactual outcomes that corresponds to the treatment value that the individual actually received is \textit{actually factual}.
\begin{mdframed}
Consistency:
\begin{center}
if $A_{i}=a,$ then $Y_{i}^{a}=Y^{A_{i}}=Y_{i}$
\end{center}
an individual with observed treatment $A=a$, has observed outcome $Y$ equal to his counterfactual outcome $Y^{a}$.
\end{mdframed}
That is, the observed outcome is equal to what (we think that) would have been observed.

In general, individual causal effects cannot be identified -- that is, cannot be expressed as a function of the observed data -- because of missing data.
