# Nand2Tetris

These are my projects in the course [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer):

* **Project 1 (Elementary Logic Gates):**
Build all the logic gates described in Chapter 1, yielding a basic chip-set.

* **Project 2 (Combinational Chips):**
Build all the chips described in Chapter 2, leading up to an Arithmetic Logic Unit - the Hack computer's ALU.

* **Project 3 (Sequential Chips):**
Build all the chips described in Chapter 3, leading up to a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit.

* **Project 4 (Machine Language Programming):**
Write and test two low-level programs, to get a taste of low-level programming in machine language, and to get acquainted with the Hack computer platform.

* **Project 5 (Computer Architecture):**
Complete the construction of the Hack CPU and the Hack hardware platform, leading up to the top-most Computer chip.

* **Project 6 (The Assembler):**
Write an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.
