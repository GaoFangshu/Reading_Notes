## Lecture 1 - Introduction and Examples
### Notes:
* price of anarchy (POA)
* In non-zero-sum game, there is no computationally efficient algorithm for computing Nash equilibrium.

### Exercises:
#### Exercise 1.1
1. In the first round knockout tournament, randomize pairing of the eight winners from round-robin phase.
2. The best team in each round-robin group have rights to select opponent from other group's top 2 teams in the first round knockout. Thus in round-robin phase, each team would try their best to get this rights.

#### Exercise 1.2
Each man will chase the best girl he wants, rather than obeying Nash's soluion.

#### Exercise 1.3
If there exists another mixed strategy different from randomizing uniformly in Rock-Paper-Scissors, that is, one player give an action (e.g. Rock) with probability larger than 1/3. Then the other player has incentive to change her distribution over strategies (e.g. give Paper more often). This is contradicted with the definition of Nash equilibrium.
